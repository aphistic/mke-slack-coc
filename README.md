# MKE Slack Code of Conduct

The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants in the MKE Slack community have the best possible experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets and have a good time!

The MKE Slack Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the MKE Slack community, in any channel, group chat, or private direct message (DM).

As a (mostly) local community, diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to, to ensure that the MKE Slack community continues to be an excellent space in which to communicate, collaborate, and contribute.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended — a guide to make it easier to be excellent to each other. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

* __Be considerate__ - Anything you say will affect others, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* __Be patient__ - Communities are often built on volunteer time both from participants and organizers. It is possible that your question or suggestion might not receive an immediate response. Be patient and consider the norms of the community. One reminder ping is welcome, many reminder pings in rapid succession are not a good display of patience. Similarly, posting the same question in multiple threads is frowned upon and should not be done.
* __Be respectful__ - Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the MKE Slack community to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside the MKE Slack community.
* __Be nice__ - Everyone in the MKE Slack community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention will not be tolerated.
* __Communicate effectively__ - We don't all speak the same language at the same skill level. Clear communication can help to avoid misunderstandings, as can remembering that our interpretations of words can be different depending on our backgrounds. Having context is important. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. Disagreements are normal, but we expect participants to resolve disagreements constructively — so please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments. Resources for how to most effectively engage with MKE Slack are shown here. (TODO)
* __Ask for help when unsure__ - Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

### Policy
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Slack.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow the directions in the "If You Need Help" section, directly below this policy.

Organizers will be happy to help participants to feel safe. We value your participation in the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules.

### If You Need Help 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting (TODO). As a community (WORDING), we take our community's health seriously and want to ensure everyone has a good experience, so please contact (TODO) if there is an issue so we can help address it.
